<p style="color:white;">GopherCon 2015
GopherCon 2014 was, by all accounts, a tremendously successful conference. With sold-out attendance of 700 people, GopherCon drew developers from across the globe.  We attracted developers ranging from hobbyist to startup CTO, from corporate developer to language designers. Attendees represented more than half of the Fortune 100 companies.

GopherCon 2015 will build on that successful platform by more than doubling the number of attendees to 1500 and moving to the Colorado Convention Center to allow us the space to continue our unique single track event while still comfortably housing 1500 people.

This year we will expand our wildly successful post-conference Hack Day which brought hundreds of developers together after the conference for a loosely-organized day of collaboration, learning, lightning talks, and camaraderie.

Gopher Academy
Gopher Academy mission is to foster a community of Go developers by providing education, training, and events.
